Fix: Critical email/password signup 500 error - UserProfile.username constraint

ISSUE:
- Email/password signups failing with HTTP 500 errors
- Google OAuth signups working correctly
- Production users unable to create accounts via email

ROOT CAUSE:
- UserProfile.username field was NOT NULL with no default value
- When User.objects.create_user() created a user, the post_save signal
  tried to create UserProfile but failed with IntegrityError
- Signal handlers had duplicate code and a bug referencing undefined 'instance'

FIXES:
1. dashboard/models.py
   - Changed username field to: CharField(max_length=150, blank=True, default='')
   - Now allows blank values, preventing IntegrityError

2. dashboard/signals.py
   - Removed duplicate signal handler functions
   - Fixed undefined variable bug on line 55
   - Added comprehensive error handling with try-except blocks
   - Better logging for debugging future issues

3. dashboard/migrations/0024_alter_userprofile_username.py
   - New migration to alter username field schema
   - Allows blank=True and sets default=''

TESTING:
- Created test_signup_fix_local.py to verify fix works
- Created deploy_signup_fix.sh for easy production deployment
- Created verify_signup_fix.sh to verify deployment success

DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Push this commit to main branch
2. SSH to production server
3. Run: ./deploy_signup_fix.sh
4. Test signup at /auth/signup/
5. Run: ./verify_signup_fix.sh
