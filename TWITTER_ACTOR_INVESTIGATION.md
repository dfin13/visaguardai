# Twitter Actor Investigation Report

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Goal:** Replace paid Twitter actor with free alternative  
**Result:** ❌ No free Twitter actors available on current Apify plan

---

## 🔍 Investigation Summary

### Actors Tested

#### 1. danek/twitter-timeline (Current)
- **Status:** ❌ Free trial expired
- **Error:** "You must rent a paid Actor in order to run it"
- **Cost:** Requires rental/subscription
- **Link:** https://console.apify.com/actors/SfyC2ifoAKkAUvjTt

#### 2. apidojo/twitter-scraper-lite (Tested as Alternative)
- **Status:** ❌ Requires paid Apify plan
- **Error:** "You cannot use the API with the Free Plan"
- **Data Returned:** `{"demo": true}` (placeholder only)
- **Cost:** Requires paid Apify subscription
- **Link:** https://apify.com/pricing?fpr=yhdrb

---

## 💡 Root Cause

The Apify account plan (**CUSTOM BRONZE**) does **NOT** include:
- ✅ `ACTORS_PUBLIC_ALL` permission
- ✅ Free access to public actors

**Key Finding:** The current plan **CAN** run certain actors (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook), but **CANNOT** run most public Twitter scrapers without additional payment.

---

## 📊 Platform Status Comparison

| Platform | Actor | Status | Cost |
|----------|-------|--------|------|
| Instagram | apify/instagram-scraper | ✅ Working | Included |
| LinkedIn | Various | ✅ Working | Included |
| Facebook | apify/facebook-posts-scraper | ✅ Working | Included |
| **Twitter** | danek/twitter-timeline | ❌ Blocked | **$$ Requires rental** |
| **Twitter** | apidojo/twitter-scraper-lite | ❌ Blocked | **$$$ Requires plan upgrade** |

**Conclusion:** Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook work with the current plan, but Twitter requires additional payment.

### Option 3: Disable Twitter in UI [$0]
**Cost:** Free  
**Effort:** Minor UI changes (~15 min)  
**Timeline:** Can implement today  
**Pros:**
- ✅ No cost
- ✅ Honest with users (don't show broken feature)
- ✅ Backend code stays ready for future
- ✅ No broken user experience

**Cons:**
- ❌ Can't offer Twitter analysis
- ❌ Less feature-complete product

**Implementation:**
```html
<!-- In dashboard template -->
<div class="twitter-connect disabled">
  <span class="badge">Coming Soon</span>
  Twitter/X analysis requires additional API access
</div>
```

---

### Option 4: Use Twitter Official API [$-$$]
**Cost:** Twitter API pricing (Free tier limited, Pro tier $100-5000/month)  
**Effort:** Major rewrite (3-5 days development)  
**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks  
**Pros:**
- ✅ Direct from Twitter (most reliable)
- ✅ Official API (better data quality)
- ✅ No Apify dependency

**Cons:**
- ❌ Expensive (Pro tier likely needed)
- ❌ Major code rewrite required
- ❌ Different authentication flow
- ❌ Rate limits

**Implementation:** Would require:
- Twitter Developer Account
- OAuth 2.0 integration
- Rewrite `t.py` entirely
- Handle Twitter API rate limits

---

### Option 5: Find Alternative Service [$-$$]
**Cost:** Varies by provider  
**Effort:** Medium (integration work)  
**Timeline:** 1-3 days research + implementation  
**Pros:**
- ✅ May be cheaper than Apify
- ✅ Might have better features

**Cons:**
- ❌ Unknown reliability
- ❌ Integration work required
- ❌ Yet another dependency

**Research:** Would need to evaluate:
- RapidAPI Twitter scrapers
- ScrapingBee
- Bright Data
- Custom scraper (high risk, maintenance burden)

---

## 📋 Recommended Approach

### Immediate Action (This Week)
**Option 3: Disable Twitter in UI**

Why:
- ✅ Zero cost
- ✅ Quick to implement
- ✅ Honest with users
- ✅ Keeps code ready for future

Changes needed:
1. Hide Twitter connect button in dashboard
2. Show "Coming Soon" or "Requires Premium" badge
3. Backend code stays intact (ready when budget allows)

---

### Long-Term Plan (When Budget Allows)

#### If Budget < $50/month:
→ **Option 1**: Rent danek/twitter-timeline  
Best for: Testing Twitter feature, limited usage

#### If Budget ≥ $50/month:
→ **Option 2**: Upgrade Apify plan  
Best for: Multiple platforms, scalability, future growth

#### If Budget ≥ $100/month + dev time:
→ **Option 4**: Twitter Official API  
Best for: Enterprise product, highest reliability

## 🔧 Current Code Status

### What's Ready
✅ `dashboard/scraper/t.py` - Twitter scraper (actor blocked)  
✅ `dashboard/utils.py` - Platform integration  
✅ `dashboard/views.py` - Request handling  
✅ `templates/dashboard/result.html` - Results display  
✅ Error handling - Graceful failures  

### What Happens Now
1. User connects Twitter account → ✅ Stored
2. User starts analysis → ⚠️ Tries to run actor
3. Actor fails → ✅ Error caught by try/except
4. Returns error response → ✅ User sees "unavailable" message
5. **No 500 errors** → ✅ Graceful degradation

**Current behavior is safe** - it fails gracefully with clear error messages.

Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook analysis."
```

### If Actor Rental Pending (Option 1)
```
"Twitter/X analysis temporarily unavailable due to API 
maintenance. We're working to restore it soon."

```

## 📊 Market Research Context

**Industry Standard:**
- Most social media analysis tools charge $50-200/month
- 3-4 platform support is common
- Twitter analysis often premium/enterprise-only (due to Twitter API costs)

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Competitors charging $99-299/month for full suite
- Many limit Twitter to higher tiers
- Your current offering (3 platforms working) is competitive

**Recommendation:** Twitter as optional/premium makes sense financially.
