## 🚨 Two Blockers to Production

### 1. Actor Access (CRITICAL) ❌
**Issue:** `danek/twitter-timeline` free trial expired  
**Impact:** Twitter scraping won't work at all  
**Owner:** User must rent actor  
**Link:** https://console.apify.com/actors/SfyC2ifoAKkAUvjTt

### 2. Metadata Extraction (MEDIUM) ⚠️
**Issue:** Code only extracts text, not URLs/timestamps/engagement  
**Impact:** Missing features, degraded UX  
**Owner:** Developer (~30 min fix)  
**Fix:** Update extraction code after actor access resolved

## 📋 Recommended Actions

### IMMEDIATE (User)
1. Go to https://console.apify.com/actors/SfyC2ifoAKkAUvjTt
2. Rent the `danek/twitter-timeline` actor
   - OR -
3. Explore alternative Twitter scrapers

### AFTER ACTOR ACCESS (Developer)
4. Rerun diagnostic: `python3 test_twitter_diagnostic.py`
5. Examine actual data structure returned
6. Update `t.py` lines 76-80 (add URL, timestamp, engagement extraction)
7. Update `t.py` lines 114-126 (add `post_url` to analyzer data)
8. Test with real profiles
9. Deploy to production (following same process as Facebook)

## ⏱️ Time Estimate

**Total:** 60-80 minutes (after actor access resolved)

- Resolve actor access: Depends on user
- Test data structure: 10 min
- Update extraction: 20-30 min
- Update data prep: 10-15 min
- Test & verify: 10-15 min
- Deploy: 10 min

## 🎯 What Works Today

✅ Text extraction from tweets  
✅ AI analysis and risk scoring  
✅ Template display  
✅ Error handling  
✅ Background processing  
✅ Session/cache management  

## ❌ What Doesn't Work

❌ Actor won't run (blocked)  
❌ No post URLs  
❌ No timestamps  
❌ No engagement data  
❌ "View original post" links don't display

## 💡 Key Insight

**The infrastructure is solid.** Twitter analysis is fully integrated and ready to work. Only two issues prevent deployment:

1. **External:** Actor needs rental (user action)
2. **Internal:** Code needs metadata extraction (30 min fix)

Once both are resolved, Twitter will be at **100% parity** with Instagram, LinkedIn, and Facebook.
