## 📋 What Was Fixed

### Issue

   - Risk badges updated with dark mode colors
   - Tweet content boxes styled with dark backgrounds
   - Profile summary cards use consistent dark text colors
   - Grade legend descriptions use dark mode styling
   - All borders, text, and backgrounds now use dark variants

3. **Updated Tailwind classes**:
   - Removed all `dark:` prefixes and made dark variants the default
   - Updated header, navigation, and button colors
   - Fixed comprehensive summary section styling
   - Updated platform performance cards
